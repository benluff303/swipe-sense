There is a old rundown castle there that you can actually walk in and to the top.  There is a golf course there as well.  Would definitely explore more if I had more time.  It is freeeee (Score: 0.5745)\n",
      "- Janeiro, Sugar Loaf cable car: This was a good visit. The views were spectacular and the ride up was fun. The whole setting is good. Different foods and dessert along with drinks and souvenir shops. They had a party in the night and the vibe was really good. There is a nature trail and it was beautiful. The reataurant is so so but fine. (Score: 0.5375)\n",
      "- Banff, Banff Canoe Club: Went kayaking along the river and it was such an incredible adventure! The views were breathtaking, and paddling through the peaceful stretches of water felt like the perfect mix of calm and excitement. Booking was quick and hassle-free, and they offer everything from kayaks to canoes depending on how you want to explore. I went for the one-hour kayak, and it was the perfect way to get out on the water and take in the scenery. Easy to find, fun from start to finish… definitely an experience I’d recommend!
